# Setting Everything Up

## Set up Conda Virtual Environment

To set up a virtual environment:

```
conda create -n environment_name python=3.7
```

Where "environment_name" is the name of the environment you want to create. For this exercise, I used "flaskenv".

## Activate Conda Environment

To activate Conda virtual environment:

```
conda activate flaskenv
```

or in Anaconda prompt, you can just use:

```
activate flaskenv
```

If you are using Bash / Linux:

```
source activate flaskenv
```

## Install All Flask Libraries Needed

We should have a requirements.txt file with all the necessary libraries. To install all of them at once, we use:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
